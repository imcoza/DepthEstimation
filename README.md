# Depth Estimation using U-Net Architecture with PyTorch

This repository provides an implementation of depth estimation using the U-Net architecture with PyTorch. Depth estimation is a computer vision task that involves predicting the depth information of a scene from a single or multiple images. U-Net is a popular architecture known for its effectiveness in image segmentation tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- PyTorch (>=1.0)
- NumPy (>=1.18)
- Matplotlib (>=3.1) (for visualization)

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install torch numpy matplotlib
```
## Dataset

For this implementation, I have assumed that you have a dataset of RGB images paired with their corresponding ground truth depth maps. You can use publicly 

This script will use the trained U-Net model to predict depth maps for a set of test images. You can visualize the input images, predicted depth maps, and compare them with the ground truth depth maps.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the U-Net architecture by modifying the `UNet` . You can experiment with the number of layers, filters, and other architectural aspects to improve performance.

## Results

You can find the generated depth maps .

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you encounter any issues or want to enhance the implementation, please feel free to create a pull request.
